## **Projects Overview**  

### 1. **Feature Selection for Alzheimer’s Diagnosis**  
- **Objective**: Identify the most representative handwriting features for predicting Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) using the DARWIN dataset.  
- **Highlights**:  
  - Analyzed high-dimensional handwriting data (450 features per participant).  
  - Explored eight feature selection methods and evaluated their impact on model performance.  
  - Developed a Random Forest classifier with Mutual Information and Bootstrapping as the best feature selection approaches.  
- **Dataset**: [DARWIN Handwriting Dataset](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2018.10.141).  
- **Notebook**: [feature_selection_AD_DARWIN.ipynb](./project01_feature_selection_AD_DARWIN.ipynb)

### 2. **Classification and Regression Exercise**  
#### Part 1: Binary Classification  
- **Objective**: Discriminate between healthy individuals and those with Parkinson’s Disease using features from voice recordings.  
- **Dataset**: [Parkinson Disease Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jainaru/parkinson-disease-detection/data).  
- **Notebook**: [parkinsons_classification_and_medical_regression.ipynb](./project02_parkinsons_classification_and_medical_regression.ipynb)  

#### Part 2: Regression  
- **Objective**: Predict healthcare insurance costs in the US using demographic and health-related data.  
- **Dataset**: [Medical Cost Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance).  
- **Notebook**: [parkinsons_classification_and_medical_regression.ipynb](./project02_parkinsons_classification_and_medical_regression.ipynb)
